<h1>Hey, Jalil here. Let me tell you a bit about myself. <br> I'm a Youtuber born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.<br> I've been introverted for a large portion of my life, so my channel was made for me to share stories<br> that I've experienced throughout my life but have always been too shy to share.<br> With these stories, you'll get some solid advice and entertainment to enjoy.<br> But most importantly, you'll get some good laughs.<br> Soo.. yeah. That's all for now.<br> If you want to get to know more about who I am and who I was, click a thumbnail and get started :)</h1>
